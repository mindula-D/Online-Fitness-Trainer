											I am driven to guide others through their fitness and wellness journey. Every person must take ownership of their health, and it is my mission
											<span class="read-more-text">
												to empower others with the skills necessary to do so. I earned a Bachelor’s Degree from the University of Vermont in Exercise and Movement Science and hold several fitness certifications. Through continuing education, I have retained the Certified Strength and Conditioning Specialist credential from the National Strength and Conditioning Association across three cycles since 2011. My experience includes time working with Division I college athletes, in an outpatient physical therapy setting, as a group fitness instructor, small group trainer, and many years as a personal trainer and habit coach. I am a positive-minded and supportive coach who enjoys the process of physical and psychological change.

											I possess nearly a decade of experience as a Certified Personal trainer and am driven by my desire to learn how to help people reach their physical 
											<span class="read-more-text">
												and personal goals. After earning an MBA, I returned to school and received an applied sciences degree from Bryan University in Advanced Personal Training and Exercise Science. I then worked within the program as an adjunct instructor for three years. I continue to absorb as much as I can in the field as well as educate others. As a lifelong learner, the opportunity to share my knowledge and learn from others drives my dedication to my clients and my profession. Over the years I have gained experience helping clients in various goals: beginning, recovery, strength, endurance, functionality, mobility; in short continually improving and maintaining quality of life.
